# Convert .csv file to .json file

This tool is a python script that will convert a .csv file to .json file. 

By default, the script will take the first system argument (file_to_convert.csv) as the file basename (with .csv stripped). The same basename will be used for the output .json file.

## Usage

```
python conversion.py path/to/file/file_to_convert.csv
```

Will output as path/to/file_to_convert.json
